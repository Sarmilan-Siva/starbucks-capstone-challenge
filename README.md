# Starbucks Capstone Challenge
This analysis, ‘Starbucks Promotion Recommendation’ is done as a part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program of Udacity. 

## Overview

According to the case study, Starbucks promotes their products through rewards to its customers through their mobile app once in every few days. 
Starbucks expectations would be

1. to increase the revenue and net income,
2. retain their customer base and 
3. encourage the customers to visit regularly or more frequently

Currently the offers are sent to random customers. Therefore this study tries to build a recommender system to suggest best offers to the customers based on their past interactions or responses to the offers that they received. This study also tries to identify which groups of customers respond to which offers positively or who are the target group for an offer for Starbucks to optimise and personalise the offers that they send out.
